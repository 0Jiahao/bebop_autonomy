Reading from Bebop

Camera
======

The video stream from Bebop's front camera is published on ``image_raw`` topic as ``sensor_msgs/Image`` messages. *bebop_driver* complies with ROS camera interface specifications and publishes camera information and calibration data to ``camera_info`` topic. Due to limitations in Parrot's ARDroneSDK3, the quality of video stream is limited to **640 x 368 @ 30 Hz**. The field of view of this virtual camera (based on our measurements) is ~80 (horizontal) and ~50 (vertical) degrees.

To set the location of camera calibration data, please check this page: :doc:`configuration`. Since v0.4, the package ships with a default camera caliberation file located at ``bebop_driver/data/bebop_front_calib.yaml``. Both default node/nodelet launch files, load this file when executing the driver.

States (aka Navdata)
====================

Unlike Parrot ARDrone, Bebop does not constantly transmit all on-board data back to the host device with high frequency. Each state variable is sent only when its value is changed. In addition, the publication rate is currently limited to **5 Hz**. The driver publishes these states **selectively** and when **explicitly** enabled through a ROS parameter. For example setting ``~states/enable_pilotingstate_flyingstatechanged`` parameter to ``true`` will enable the publication of flying state changes to topic ``states/ARDrone3/PilotingState/FlyingStateChanged``. List of all such parameters and their corresponding topics and message types are indexed in the following pages:
